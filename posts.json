Taking the role of UI Programmer was a great chance to to have some some fun in the Unity game engine whilst being part of a multifaceted team. The theme we were given was Cornwall and “a famous dead person”, we figured that a dark horror styled game of chasing evil piskies around the island of Saint Michaels Mount while being hunted by King Arthurs ghost was pretty bang on.",
